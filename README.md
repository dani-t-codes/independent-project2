# Adventures in Coding Languages

#### Week 2 of Epicodus Coding Boot Camp, Javascript & jQuery Practice Exercise, 10.23.20

#### By Danielle Thompson

## Description
_{This project is meant to be a brief showcase of the skills learned during my second week of Epicodus' Intro to Programming unit, specifically focusing on using Javascript & jQuery alongside HTML & CSS pages. Branching, use of jQuery, and use input from user form data are main objectives.}_

## Motivation 
_{This application employs a quiz meant to help people interested in coding decide which language to learn first. Especially for a beginner, unfamiliar with tech- and computer-related terminology, there are *so* many languages to navigate and choose from. It is my hope that a user will find this brief synopsis of several popular coding languages and their survey results helpful to choosing the best language to begin with.}_

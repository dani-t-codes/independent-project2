# Choose Your Own Adventures in Coding Languages

#### Week 2 of Epicodus Coding Boot Camp, Javascript & jQuery Practice Exercise, 10.23.20

#### By Danielle Thompson

## Description
_{This project is meant to be a brief showcase of the skills learned during my second week of Epicodus' Intro to Programming unit, specifically focusing on using Javascript & jQuery alongside HTML & CSS pages. Branching, use of jQuery, and use input from user form data are main objectives.}_

## Motivation 
_{This application is a "Choose-your-own-Adventure" style application meant to help people interested in coding decide which language to learn first. Especially for a beginner, unfamiliar with tech- and computer-related terminology, there are *so* many languages to navigate and choose from. It is my hope that this brief synopsis of several popular coding languages will help folks new to tech choose the best language to begin with.}_

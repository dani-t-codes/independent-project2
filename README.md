# Adventures in Coding Languages

#### Week 2 of Epicodus Coding Boot Camp, Javascript & jQuery Practice Exercise, 10.23.20

#### By Danielle Thompson

## Description
_This project is meant to be a brief showcase of the skills learned during my second week of Epicodus' Intro to Programming unit, specifically focusing on using Javascript & jQuery alongside HTML & CSS pages. Branching, use of jQuery, and integrating input from the user form data are the main objectives._

## Motivation 
_This application shares some basic information about various coding languages out there in the wide, wide world, and employs a quiz meant to help people interested in coding decide which language to learn first. Especially for a beginner, unfamiliar with tech- and computer-related terminology, there are *so* many languages to navigate and choose from. It is my hope that a user will find this brief synopsis of several popular coding languages and their survey results helpful to choosing the best language to begin with. (Quiz questions and answers do *not* share exact information about code languages - most Q & A content is random.)_

## Design 
_Color scheme: #EDC7B7, #EEE2DC, #BAB2B5, #123C69, #AC3861_

## Technologies & Libraries used

* _Javascript_
* _Bootstrap Library_
* _jQuery Library_

## Complete setup instructions
* _In the Terminal for Mac users or Command Prompt program for Windows users, clone this application from this (GitHub repository)[https://github.com/dani-t-codes/independent-project2] with the following command:_
* _`git clone https://github.com/dani-t-codes/independent-project2` _
* _Open the index.html in your web browser of choice, either by double-clicking the file icon inside the project folder, or by opening File>Open File>"index.html" from the independent-project2 folder that you cloned onto your computer._
* _Read through the information on the index page as much, or as little as you wish._
* _Find and follow the link to be redirected to the quiz at the bottom of the home (index.html) page._
* _Take the quiz & find out which coding language you should start learning first!_

## Known bugs

_As of 10.25.20, the quiz only shows one answer at a time, as it should, but the values of each answer in the quiz do not total up to produce one result as they should._

_The 'testing.js' page is intentionally not linked in anywhere, and merely contains my "chicken scratch", tests, previous code that got refactored, and future thinking to make all five question answers connect to a single result. It is largely meant to be ignored, except for myself._
